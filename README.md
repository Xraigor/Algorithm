about algorithm projectï¼š Neural network algorithm

Neural network algorithm is very popular in machine learning, and can be used in many kinds of field.
It can realizes handwritten character recognition system, using basic Back Propagation Algorithm; or using Convolutional neural network for image classification.If going further, we can also use it to Complete face recognition task.

I know that there are already a lot of software that can accomplish the above tasks relatively quickly. But I want to learn about the basic theory about how to realize a neural network model, about the Basic mathematical algorithm logic behind. There are also many different kinds of Neural network algorithm to fit in different kinds of tasks. My goal is to know if I can use different algorithm to solve the same question, and to Explain the differences between the various algorithms if it goes well.
